# Jenkins Job DSL automation starter

Skeleton for [Job DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin) based [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) CI/CD automation projects.

Allows to quickly bootstrap Gradle project ready to create and test Job DSL scripts.

## Samples

Starter contains code samples that showcase how to create and test DSL scripts as well as allow to test updates (e.g. Jenkins, Job DSL plugin).

## Bootstrap steps

* remove sample job
* remove code from main sources
* remove tests from com.twitter.kszdev.jenkins.jobdsl.custom package
* remove tests from com.twitter.kszdev.jenkins.jobdsl.job package
* remove test resources
* remove or update README files
* rename packages in test sources
* update list of plugins available in tests
* update DSL scripts' references in tests

## Repository structure
